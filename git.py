# def addition(a, b):
a=1
b=2
 	summation = a + b

 	return summation

Oh wow look at this new bit of text im writing...

#def subtraction(a, b):

# 	difference = a - b

# 	return difference


# def division(a, b):

# 	quotient = a / b

# 	return quotient


# def multiplication(a, b):

# 	product = a * b
